As a developing a Atm Interface the first step was to understand the requirements of the ATM interface. I outlined basic functionalities such as checking available balance, Depositing money, Withdrawing money and view Mini-statements, along with security features like Atm number and Pin num verification.

I structured the project by creating four different classes to represent the ATM interface, User accounts details in main class , and implementation on ATM operations. As it helped in organizing the code and making it more Understandable.

I utilized HashMap to store account numbers, PINs, View Mini-statements and corresponding balances. This enabled efficient retrieval and manipulation of account details of user.

For user interaction, I developed a interface class for console where users could input their account number and PIN to access ATM options. As Implementing this interface enhanced my understanding of user input/output handling in Java.

As I worked on this project, on experimentation with Java programming, I gained a deep understanding of some oops concepts, interface, constructor, and file I/O operations. also a developing real-world application. And I owned my java skills & gained insights into creating interfaces that enhance user engagement.
